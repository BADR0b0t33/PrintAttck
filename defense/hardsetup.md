Absolutely. Here’s an expanded, step-by-step **Purple Team lab setup flow** using your **Windows 11 and Kali Linux VMs in VirtualBox**, combined with your **SAX1V1K WiFi 6 router** and **EN2251 Spectrum modem**:

---

# Purple Team Lab Setup Flow — Expanded

---

## Step 1: Physical & Network Infrastructure Preparation

### 1.1 Confirm Hardware Status

* Ensure your **Spectrum EN2251 modem** is either physically disconnected or powered off to guarantee no external internet access.
* Power on and reset the **SAX1V1K WiFi 6 router** to factory defaults for a clean configuration slate.

### 1.2 Connect Your Host Machine

* Connect your physical host (the machine running VirtualBox) to the **SAX1V1K router** via Ethernet (preferable for stability) or WiFi.

---

## Step 2: SAX1V1K Router Configuration

### 2.1 Disable WAN / Internet Access

* Log into router management (usually `192.168.1.1` or similar).
* Disable the WAN port or disconnect the modem from the router’s WAN port. This isolates your lab network.

### 2.2 Setup DHCP Server on Router (Optional)

* Enable DHCP server for your LAN with a fixed IP pool (e.g., `192.168.50.100` to `192.168.50.200`).
* Set subnet mask to `255.255.255.0`.
* Set router LAN IP (gateway) to `192.168.50.1`.

### 2.3 WiFi & LAN Setup

* Disable or secure WiFi SSIDs if you want to limit access to lab devices only.
* Ensure your host machine and any physical tools are connected.

### 2.4 Set Router Firewall Rules (Optional)

* Configure rules to block all outbound traffic to the WAN interface.
* Limit inbound LAN traffic if needed to isolate segments.

---

## Step 3: VirtualBox Network Configuration

### 3.1 Create Internal Network for Purple Team Lab

* In VirtualBox Manager, open VM settings for Kali and Windows 11 VMs.
* For **Adapter 1**:

  * Set **Attached to:** `Internal Network`
  * Network Name: `PurpleLabNet` (or any name you prefer)
* This creates an isolated virtual LAN visible only to VMs connected to this network.

### 3.2 Create Host-Only Network for VM-Host Communication

* VirtualBox > File > Host Network Manager
* Create a new Host-Only network (e.g., `vboxnet0`).
* Assign Adapter 2 in both VMs to **Host-Only Adapter**, attach to `vboxnet0`.
* This adapter allows you to access VMs from the host OS for file transfers, management, and monitoring.

### 3.3 (Optional) Bridged Adapter for Physical LAN Access

* If you want VMs to communicate with physical devices on SAX1V1K LAN, add **Adapter 3** in bridged mode connected to your physical NIC.
* Be cautious to maintain isolation as needed.

## Step 4: VM OS Network Setup

### 4.1 Assign IPs on Internal Network `PurpleLabNet`

| VM        | Interface | IP Address  | Subnet Mask   | Gateway                       |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Kali      | Adapter 1 | 10.10.10.10 | 255.255.255.0 | None or 10.10.10.1 (optional) |
| Windows11 | Adapter 1 | 10.10.10.20 | 255.255.255.0 | None or 10.10.10.1 (optional) |

* Static IPs avoid dependency on DHCP, simplifying predictability.

### 4.2 Host-Only Network IPs

* Let VirtualBox DHCP assign IPs or assign static IPs within the host-only subnet (e.g., `192.168.56.x`).

---

## Step 5: VM Software Installation & Hardening

### 5.1 Kali Linux VM

* Install latest Kali Linux ISO or your custom Purple ISO.
* Update all packages (`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`).
* Install pentesting tools: Metasploit, Nmap, BloodHound, Mimikatz, etc.
* Install Python3 and Atomic Red Team toolkit for scripted ATT\&CK emulations.

### 5.2 Windows 11 VM

* Install Windows 11 with latest patches.
* Harden by enabling Defender and install Sysmon for advanced event logging.
* Deploy EDR/endpoint agents if available (for example, OSQuery, Sysmon, or commercial agents).
* Install ELK forwarder or configure Windows Event Forwarding to a SIEM VM or host.

---

## Step 6: Centralized Logging & Monitoring (Optional Third VM)

* Deploy an **ELK Stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Security Onion** VM.
* Configure Windows 11 and Kali to send logs here:

  * Windows Event Logs via Winlogbeat or NXLog.
  * Kali logs via Syslog or filebeat.
* This provides a central detection and analysis platform.

---

## Step 7: Purple Team Workflow Setup

### 7.1 Define Attack Scenarios

* Map attack chains from MITRE ATT\&CK framework relevant to your objectives.
* Prepare scripted tests using Atomic Red Team or custom payloads (including fileless techniques, LOLBins, DLL injection, etc.).

### 7.2 Detection & Response

* On Windows 11, tune Sysmon and Defender to detect the scripted attack behaviors.
* Monitor SIEM dashboards for alerts.

### 7.3 Iterative Testing

* Run attacks from Kali targeting Windows 11.
* Analyze logs and alerts.
* Tune detection rules or endpoint configurations.
* Document gaps and improve both offensive and defensive measures.

---

## Step 8: Optional Advanced Configurations

### 8.1 Simulate Network Segmentation

* Use VLANs on your SAX1V1K router if supported, or configure virtual firewalls on your VMs.

### 8.2 Implement Fileless Malware Scenarios

* Develop or deploy reflective DLL injection, PowerShell Empire, or other advanced attacks.

### 8.3 Quantum-Resistant Crypto Testing

* Experiment with post-quantum crypto libraries and analyze detection impact.

---

## Step 9: Backup & Reset Procedures

* Snapshot VMs before starting each exercise.
* Use Ansible or PowerShell DSC scripts to reset configurations post-exercise for a clean slate.
