## 🧭 Pre-Ransomware Targeting: Dummy Infrastructure + Google Dorks

### 🎯 Objective:

Establish a realistic dummy target and discover vulnerable internet-exposed printers for reconnaissance and access, as a precursor to lateral movement or payload delivery (e.g., ransomware or wiperware).

---

### 🧱 Step 1: Set Up Dummy Target Infrastructure

#### 📍 Purpose:

Mimic a legitimate internal asset (e.g., a networked printer or Windows endpoint) to:

* Serve as a **honeypot** or bait
* **Simulate** attack surface for offensive testing

#### ⚙️ Tools:

* [`PRET`](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET): Printer Exploitation Toolkit
* `Printer Exploitation Framework (PEF)`
* Python SimpleHTTPServer / PHP built-in server
* Simulated services using Docker or open ports with banners

#### 🏗 Deployment Example:

```bash
# Simulate a printer web interface
docker run -d -p 631:631 --name fake_printer ghcr.io/simulated-systems/ipp-printer:latest
```

### 🔍 Step 2: Use Google Dorks to Find Real Vulnerable Printers

#### 🕵️ Top Printer-Focused Google Dorks:

```txt
inurl:"/printer/main.html"
inurl:"/hp/device/this.LCDispatcher" intitle:"HP"
inurl:"/admin/Top.html" "Canon"
inurl:"/admin.html" intitle:"Epson"
intitle:"Printer Status" "Konica"
intitle:"Web Image Monitor" inurl:"/wim" "Ricoh"
inurl:"/PJL" "OKI"
inurl:"/hp/device/" "Series" intext:"Configuration Page"
inurl:"/view/configure.html" intitle:"Brother"
inurl:"/cgi-bin/printer/printer.cgi"
intitle:"Xerox WorkCentre"
intitle:"Web JetAdmin" inurl:"hp"
```

> Use site filtering for geo-targeting (e.g., `site:.gov`, `site:.edu`, or `location-based keywords`).

#### 🧭 Targeting Specific Locations

To find printers in a city/organization:

```txt
inurl:"/printer/main.html" "New York University"
intitle:"Printer Status" "Tokyo" inurl:"/admin"
inurl:"/hp/device/this.LCDispatcher" "Ministry of Health"
```

Use tools like:

* 🔎 [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=printer)
* 🌍 [Censys](https://search.censys.io/)
* 🛰 [ZoomEye](https://zoomeye.org/)

### 🧰 Step 3: Fingerprint and Interact with Printers

#### Tools:

* `PRET`: Dump memory, print jobs, files
* `SNMPwalk` for printer enumeration:

  ```bash
  snmpwalk -v1 -c public <printer_ip>
  ```
* `nmap` with printer detection:

  ```bash
  nmap -p 515,631,9100 --script=snmp-info <target>
  ```

#### Exploitable Features:

* Exposed JetDirect (port 9100)
* Open web admin panel
* Weak default credentials (admin\:admin / guest)
* File system traversal or firmware upgrade features

---

### 🎯 Outcome

With these steps, you can:

* Discover and validate real-world, exposed printers
* Interact with the system filelessly or via network protocols
* Stage fileless malware via print jobs (e.g., PostScript/JetDirect)
* Mimic pre-ransomware access patterns (e.g., reconnaissance → exploit → lateral)
