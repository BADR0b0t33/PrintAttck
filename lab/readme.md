Here’s a forward-thinking, professional workflow overview combining your Windows VM scenario, attack vector using `rundll32.exe` with a `.jpg` dropper payload, privilege escalation, and threat detection via Snort/Wireshark. I’ll expand with usage examples and key steps.

## Windows VM Attack & Detection Workflow

### 1. Initial Access & Command Prompt with Shift+F10

* On Windows login or setup screen, press **Shift + F10** to open a command prompt window.
* Launch **PowerShell** from the prompt for enhanced scripting/control:

  ```powershell
  powershell
  ```
* From PowerShell, you can launch **explorer.exe** or manipulate accessibility tools like `utilman.exe` (Utility Manager), which can be swapped to run cmd or PowerShell for persistence or privilege escalation.

### 2. Leverage Accessibility Utility Hijack (Optional)

* Replace or hijack `utilman.exe` to execute cmd or PowerShell as SYSTEM (requires admin or exploit access).
* This can allow escalation or bypass of login restrictions.

### 3. Open Browser via “Learn More” Link

* On the login screen or from the utility manager, find the **“Learn More”** link directing to a browser window.
* This browser can be abused to download files, such as a disguised payload (`dropper.jpg`).

### 4. Privilege Escalation with User Management Commands

* Use `net user` commands for user enumeration and privilege escalation:

  ```cmd
  net user
  net user attacker P@ssw0rd /add
  net localgroup administrators attacker /add
  ```
* This adds a new admin user to escalate privileges and maintain persistence.

### 5. Payload Delivery: Download and Execute via rundll32.exe

* Log into Gmail or webmail from the browser, download a malicious `.jpg` file that is actually a DLL dropper (using filename obfuscation).
* On the victim machine, execute the dropper with:

  ```cmd
  rundll32.exe dropper.jpg,DllMain
  ```
* This command runs the DLL export `DllMain` within the disguised file, triggering payload execution ("evil magic").

## Threat Detection Workflow Using Snort and Wireshark

### Snort Setup and Usage (Signature-Based Detection)

* **Snort** is a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) useful for detecting suspicious network behavior.

**Basic Snort Command:**

```bash
snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0 -A console
```

* `-c` specifies config, `-i` interface, `-A console` outputs alerts to terminal.

**Example rule snippet to detect rundll32 execution:**

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any 445 (msg:"Potential DLL execution via SMB"; content:"rundll32.exe"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

**Expand Snort rules to detect:**

* Unusual SMB or HTTP downloads of suspicious file types (`.jpg` with DLL content).
* PowerShell or cmd injection commands.
* Exploits or privilege escalation behavior patterns.

### Wireshark for Packet Capture and Analysis

* Run Wireshark on the victim or network segment to capture network traffic.
* Apply filters to identify suspicious activity:

  * HTTP file downloads:

    ```wireshark
    http.request.uri contains ".jpg"
    ```
  * DNS lookups to suspicious domains.
  * SMB or RPC calls associated with lateral movement or privilege escalation.

**Basic Capture Command (TShark CLI):**

```bash
tshark -i eth0 -w capture.pcap -f "tcp port 80 or tcp port 443"
```

* Capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic for analysis.

## Summary Workflow

| Step                    | Action                                  | Example Commands / Tools           | Notes                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1. Initial Access       | Shift+F10 → cmd / PowerShell            | `powershell`, `explorer.exe`       | Bypass login with cmd or utilman hijack |
| 2. Browser Access       | Use “Learn More” link to launch browser | Manual click                       | Download malicious `.jpg` DLL payload   |
| 3. Privilege Escalation | Add admin user with net user commands   | `net user attacker P@ssw0rd /add`  | Establish admin for persistence         |
| 4. Payload Execution    | Execute dropper via rundll32            | `rundll32.exe dropper.jpg,DllMain` | Runs DLL export from disguised image    |
| 5. Threat Detection     | Monitor with Snort & Wireshark          | `snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf`   | Detect network signs of exploitation    |

## Final Notes

* The use of **rundll32.exe** to execute DLLs hidden in `.jpg` files is a classic technique of file masquerading, evading simple extension-based detection.
* Network-based detection (Snort) combined with host-based analysis (PowerShell logs, process monitoring) provides better defense.
* Privilege escalation via `net user` is trivial post-access, so disabling physical access or interactive login bypass techniques is critical.
* Consider also running Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools and monitoring Windows Event Logs for suspicious activity, process injection, and unexpected rundll32 executions.
