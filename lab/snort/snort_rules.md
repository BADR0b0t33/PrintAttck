Here’s a set of focused **Snort rules** tailored to your scenario — detecting:

* Suspicious `rundll32.exe` usage potentially executing DLL payloads disguised as `.jpg`
* HTTP downloads of suspicious file types like `.jpg` or `.dll`
* `net user` commands used for privilege escalation via SMB or HTTP
* PowerShell or cmd shell commands over the network

---

## Snort Rules for Your Scenario

### 1. Detect rundll32.exe Execution Over SMB or HTTP

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Suspicious rundll32.exe execution detected"; 
    content:"rundll32.exe"; nocase; 
    sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

*Purpose:* Detects traffic containing the keyword `rundll32.exe` indicating possible DLL execution or command injection.

---

### 2. Detect Download of `.jpg` Files Potentially Used as DLL Droppers

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Suspicious .jpg download - possible masqueraded DLL payload"; 
    content:".jpg"; nocase; http_uri; 
    flow:to_client; 
    sid:1000002; rev:1;)
```

*Purpose:* Detects HTTP requests for `.jpg` files which might be disguised malicious DLL payloads.

---

### 3. Detect `net user` Commands for Privilege Escalation

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Potential net user command execution detected"; 
    content:"net user"; nocase; 
    sid:1000003; rev:1;)
```

*Purpose:* Alerts on traffic carrying `net user` commands, common in local user creation or privilege escalation.

---

### 4. Detect PowerShell Command Execution Over Network

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"PowerShell command detected"; 
    content:"powershell"; nocase; 
    sid:1000004; rev:1;)
```

*Purpose:* Catches network activity involving PowerShell command invocation which can be used for lateral movement or payload delivery.

---

### 5. Detect Downloads or Execution of `.dll` Files

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Suspicious .dll download or execution attempt"; 
    content:".dll"; nocase; http_uri; 
    flow:to_client; 
    sid:1000005; rev:1;)
```

*Purpose:* Identifies HTTP downloads or network traffic involving `.dll` files, possibly malicious payloads.

---

## Deployment Notes

* **SID** (Snort ID) numbers are arbitrary but should be unique in your ruleset.
* These rules are generic; **tuning** for your environment (IP ranges, ports, protocols) will reduce false positives.
* Combine with **flow** and **protocol** keywords to narrow down traffic (e.g., only HTTP or SMB).
* Enable logging to file or console to verify alerts:

  ```bash
  snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0 -A console
  ```
* You can add thresholds to reduce noise on repeated alerts.

---

## Example Rule Combination for HTTP Traffic Only:

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"Suspicious .jpg download over HTTP"; content:".jpg"; nocase; http_uri; flow:to_client; sid:1000010; rev:1;)
```
